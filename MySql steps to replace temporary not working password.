MySql steps to replace temporary not working password.

Doing these steps under OSX 10.11 El Capitan and MySQL 5.7.X, should do the trick.

Considering that you already have MySQL installed then..

Open a terminal window and type:

sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server stop
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
Since the command fired in the step 2 will be under on going state, you need to open another terminal window and then type:

mysql -u root -p
UPDATE mysql.user SET password_expired='N', authentication_string=PASSWORD('') WHERE User='root';
quit;
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server restart
Important: in the step 2 you must replace for your password.

Hope it will wok for you.
